            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I approached this assignment with the brief in mind "Selling myself in 10 years", Using this I created multiple designs in photoshop for a basic website design and ended up landing on a mosaic style page using alot of white space for a minimal
                and abstract look. I felt that this design really stood out to me as in many of the personal projects I have made they focus heavily on the coding portion and being well designed of in the idea itself, instead of very well executed art,
                I tend to focus on the core and polish. Which I believe that this website represents my coding and design philosophy in all my projects.
                <br> I chose to not heavily use javascript as my skills lack in this area and also that a heavy use of java script in websites can usually endup harming the user experiance and making it a more convuluted process. I have seen this alot
                on website design for portfolios and these end up being difficult to navigate or having very bad performance whilst looking very nice.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Who is your audience?</p>
            <p>Indepedent developers looking to hire, and hiring managers in indie-large studios</p>
            <ul>
                <li>https://www.chauhogamedesigner.com/ - What kind of content I should be using and how I should display this</li>
                <li>http://dennislofgren.com/gamedesignportfolio - Again what kind of content I should use and how I should display it</li>
                <li>https://www.designbombs.com/best-modern-design-portfolios/ - This was one of the lists I looked at to gain inspiration but I didn't look at these in depth more at visual and aesthestic style to see what I could use/replicate</li>
                <li>https://www.artstation.com/oliverjones - Art station is something I wanted to heavily lean into and have a similar feel for the concept art page</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Resource on portfolio creation</p>
            <p>I relied upon previous knowledge from a past course I had taken with a concept artist and web designer (at my previous college), I didn't really rely upon anything on "How to create an online portfolio" I just used the resources above to figure
                out what is the best way to show off your work, I found that this is in 2 ways. For art is a gallary that is similar to artstations way of displaying art, and for more complex work such as games programming and games design. The best way
                to show this work off is through a blog style layout with articles images and then links to other areas of your work.

            <h2>Planning</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Very minimal use of colours and ensuring good readability by trying to minimize the amount of text on difficult to read colours and having black on white background usually for easily readable text</li>
                <li>Large navigation and slighty larger than average fonts, with using a clear font to ensure readability and visibility of information</li>
                <li>Use of bold, and different font sizes to show information and their importance to draw the eye.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I think I reached a good balance of keeping aesthestics throughout the website and good navigation, Instead of having the nav bar on all pages, it is only located on the main landing page which can be accessed by clicking onto my name at the
                top center of every webpage. I wanted to keep the website very neutral for accessbility reasons however, I need to talk to someone/research more about the abstract design being used for the background of the website, for now I have tried
                to keep as much text on a white background for clear visiblity for people with difficulties reading.

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I heavily used the Mozilla developer page to have correct syntax</li>
                <li>When implimenting the blog style format for my text, and images I went through different variations of galleries, grids, popouts etc. I eventually landed on a basic grid system that is determined by a div holding rows and inside of this
                    div, multiple columns divs that I would use to have imgs, text etc. This was difficult to figure out as the images I intended to use was very large and needed to be scaled down. I ended up relying on mozilla developer forms and stackover
                    flow along with w3schools to take information from forums. I did not copy and paste code however. I looked for the best solutions and took parts from each of the forums I had read. W3Schools showed me the method
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Learning</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For the abstract design I used the libary we are learning in introduction to programming, PSJ5 as it seems assesible and for my use case a very easy option to use, with alot of graphics options and alot of potential for anything that isn't
                    too complex.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Libraries and other resources</p>
            <ul>
                <li>PSJ5 - I used this to impliment the mosaic/abstract design in the back of the website on all of the pages</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>What worked well</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I think the general design of the website makes it more interesting than most but also simple, and easy to read and find what you are looking for. So navigation and accessbility are good.</li>
                    <li>I think that it I made it to how I planned it in the design and I achieved what I wanted to make for a portfolio site, as it displays information clearly, w ho am i and what I want to do.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What might be improved</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improving the load times of the images somehow?</li>
                    <li>Making the background of the website randomized whilst still looking good, this means that it would be easier for the developer to create more webpages with different layouts and legnths of pages without having to manually add new
                        abstract in the background.</li>
                    <li>Getting more feedback on the websites content and how this content that is displayed would be very benefical I think to see if the way i am currently displaying the information like the "blogstyle" way is effective or if I should display
                        information in a different way</li>

                <br>
                <a>The mosaic design changed quite alot in for functuality wise, as it added unneeded complexity to the website and would make it more difficult to navigate and complicate showing alot of information
                    so I decided to change to a more blog style post with specific webpages, and this fulfils the brief better I believe.
